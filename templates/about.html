            We believe in doing well by doing good, for us profit is not the only way to measure business success but it is also measured by its purpose values and impact. 

            As first-year students, this idea was coined among us during a hackathon which turned into a reality to provide luxury to its users to buy used Academics as well as Non-Academic books at a great price. 

            Our aim is not just to make the book reselling process for the senior students efficient but also to impact the nature in a positive manner in the process. We also aim to provide our users especially aiming at students to provide other digital study content on our platform in this pandemic era to play our role as literacy partners. 

            We believe in the power of knowledge and our goal is to help those who supply it and share it with those who crave it. The rest of the story is still being written, we invite you to join us on our journey. It is only going to get better. A lot better actually.
